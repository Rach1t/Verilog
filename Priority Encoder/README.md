### This directory contains 4-bit priority encoder implmented using for-generate, ifelse and case statements.
- priority_encoder, ifelsee files uses for-generate and if-else respectively and are equally efficient in terms of hardware.
- priority_encoder file can be used for making a L-bit priority encoder by changing the value of parameter L.
- case statement uses some extra hardware for implemetation.
