### This is the parameterised code for floating-point adder-cum-subtractor
- Adder.v is the main module and there is one sub-module by the name of priority_encoder.v 
- priority_encoder.v isn't really a priority encoder, it just gives the value of count by which mantissa of result needs to be left shifted to get normalised answer.
