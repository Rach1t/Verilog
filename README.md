## Verilog
This repository contains some standalone verilog modules that can be reused and made a part of larger system and most of the modules are parameterised i.e, you can make a circuit of any bit_length by varying the parameter. All modules are synthesizable. In case you want to report any bug/ give suggestion or want help, feel free to mail me at rach1t.s1n9h@gmail.com 
<br> List of modules:</br>
1. <a href="https://github.com/Rach1t/Verilog/tree/main/Basic%20Full%20Adder">Basic Full Adder</a>
2. IEEE-754 Adder
3. IEEE-754 Floating point divider
4. Kogge stone Adder
5. Priority Encoder
6. IEEE 754 multiplier
7. Quick Sort (hardware implementation of quick sort using verilog)
